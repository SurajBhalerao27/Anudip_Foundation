Ques - Why is Java known as a platform independent language?
Ans - 
	Java  is a platform independent language because it follows the WORA rule means Write Once Run Anywhere.
if a system have JDK installed in it then it defenately run .class file on it.
JDK is must to run java program.
Platform independent means if I write code on windows machine and compile it and runs the compiled code on Ubuntu machine then it works fine.
